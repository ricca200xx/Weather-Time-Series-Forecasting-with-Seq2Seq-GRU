# Weather-Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Seq2Seq-GRU
This project presents a PyTorch solution to the Deep Learning Course Challenge, predicting 76 weather variables for 30 future steps from 90 historical steps. It employs a Seq2Seq GRU model with data standardization, teacher forcing, and noise injection for robust time-series forecasting, minimizing the MASE metric.
